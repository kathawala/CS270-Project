# CS270-Project
Poetry Explorer lets you browse for poems based on special tags we generated as part of our CS 270 project

## Setup

To set up and run the program, please do the following.

1. Install required packages for Python.
   
   This step assumes you use the Python package manager [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
2. Download MongoDB and set it up on your local computer
   
   Follow the instructions for your Operating System. I have linked a few pages which detail how to set up the database on different platforms.

3. Load the MongoDB database with the poem data

## Usage

To use the webapp, first run the following in your terminal
